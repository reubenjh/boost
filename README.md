# Rockey boost

A little spaceship game I made to learn a bit of Unity Game Engine and C# for a personal project at Dev Academy while I was studying.

I had WebGL build issues and couldn't get it running on a server and still haven't been able to so it lives in github now until I decide to play with it again.

wee demo at https://youtu.be/UEk1Mzmd-dA - you can tell I played it a lot.
